# EcoWeather-Forecast-App
coWeather AI is a smart weather and air-quality forecasting application that combines real-time environmental data, machine learning models, and an interactive dashboard to deliver accurate insights. The system fetches live weather and pollution metrics using APIs, predicts 7-day future trends, and visualizes them in a clean, user-friendly interface.

# What EcoWeather AI Does
Fetches real-time weather data (temperature, humidity, wind speed) using OpenWeatherMap API
Retrieves live air quality metrics (AQI, PM2.5 levels) via AirVisual API
Simulates environmental data for model training using NumPy & Pandas
Uses LSTM (Deep Learning) for weather & AQI time-series forecasting
Uses XGBoost to predict AQI with high accuracy
Displays all insights on a modern Streamlit dashboard with interactive charts
Provides 7-day predictions for weather and pollution trends
